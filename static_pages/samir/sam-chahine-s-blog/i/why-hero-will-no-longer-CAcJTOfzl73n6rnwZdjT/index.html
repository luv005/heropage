My name's Sam and I built *Hero* almost 2 years ago.


Since then, the boom of AI has engulfed me in all it has promised its many weary travellers. Unfortunately, I lost track of what Hero was _supposed_ to be. A place to share the things you care about.


I did tonnes of research with my reddit posts, finding new ways to get the most out of AI, sneaky was to create fun images, and built tonnes of resources. Unfortunately, I also invested too much time and money into providing users with AI on Hero, something I had no right in doing. Not for my lack of originality, nor for the lack of efforts I've personally had in the evolution of AI!


I'll be redirecting all AI-app related pages to this post, so that you are not left in the dark. I apologise for this inconvenience, but I know you'll find a more suited application for your need. 


Good luck to all of you, and good luck to myself too, that I will not get distracted again ❣️😊
