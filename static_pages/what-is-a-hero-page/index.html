You can use it for sharing links, blogs, photos, files and more with your community, clients or team.<br><br>Every so often, there is a new platform gaining popularity. We have watched the life cycles of social media networks such as Facebook go from being exclusively for American College students to now being the site where the average age of those who pass regularly tends to be in the older years.<br><br>You cannot go anywhere without hearing a reference to <a href="/link-in-bio-on-tiktok" class="sc-dvwKko kvIomC">TikTok</a>, and we are seeing Instagram cling to dear life. Those platforms gain popularity through the ability to personalise and share parts of their life with real-life and internet friends.<br><br>Unfortunately, there are limits. From no links in captions to being unable to find that recipe post you suddenly need six months after somebody sent it to you- there are always those downsides that make them a little frustrating.<br><br>As much as many of us want to escape the clutches that social media may have on our lives, you cannot deny these platforms are a great way to share links and information- so what if there is a better way? Well, there is, and that is by creating a <a href="/" class="sc-dvwKko kvIomC">Hero Page</a>.<br><br>Switching and learning new platforms is always challenging, so we tend to stick to the same ones for their lifecycle. That is why before we jump into what a hero page is regarding how this platform works, let's pull it back a little more generally. Think of websites you visit and how often they have a page at the start.<br><br>It can be an image or minimal information leading you to the site. In developer terms, that is called a landing page. Does that sound more familiar? If not- then that's fine. That page can also be called a hero page or a hero image. Let's get into it.</p><p class="sc-iqGgem hvrSHD">Table of Contents</p><div class="sc-kjEcyX iQOMYV"><ol><li class="sc-kTvvXX pexoJ"><a href="#what-is-a-hero-page" class="sc-dvwKko kvIomC">What is a Hero Page?</a></li><li class="sc-kTvvXX pexoJ"><a href="#what-can-i-do-in-a-hero-page" class="sc-dvwKko kvIomC">What can I do with a Hero Page?</a></li><li class="sc-kTvvXX pexoJ"><a href="#what-content-can-share-in-a-hero-link" class="sc-dvwKko kvIomC">What Content Can I Share in a Hero Link?</a></li><li class="sc-kTvvXX pexoJ"><a href="#the-magic-of-a-hero-page" class="sc-dvwKko kvIomC">The Magic of a Hero Page</a></li><li class="sc-kTvvXX pexoJ"><a href="#why-you-need-a-hero-page" class="sc-dvwKko kvIomC">Why You Need a Hero Page</a></li></ol></div><span id="what-is-a-hero-page"></span><br><br><br><h2 class="sc-fmrZth bbgwqn">1. What is a Hero Page?</h2><br><p class="sc-iqGgem hvrSHD">A Hero Page or a landing page is known as the first page of a website, and it is populated with unlimited hero pages which are used to share lists of links.<br><br>It is not always the home page, but it is a page that acts as a gateway between you and the information you want to share.<br><br>People generally refer to that when they talk about a hero page for a website. Now let's take that concept and run with it.</p><span id="what-can-i-do-in-a-hero-page"></span><br><br><br><h2 class="sc-fmrZth bbgwqn">2. What can I do with a Hero Page?</h2><br><p class="sc-iqGgem hvrSHD">Taking the concept of a Hero Page, we have designed a platform that allows you to create your own hero page.<br><br>This page will act as a gateway to share any information you so desire.<br><br>Links, blogs, photos... the limit is only your imagination.<br><br>It is personal to you; no matter what content you want to share, you will have the platform to do so.</p><span id="what-content-can-share-in-a-hero-link"></span><br><br><br><h2 class="sc-fmrZth bbgwqn">3. What Content Can I Share in a Hero Link?</h2><br><p class="sc-iqGgem hvrSHD">Once you create your Hero profile, you can create an unlimited number of Spaces, which are what we call a page with a list of links.<br><br>You can then share this Space, with a Hero link that you can find on each page!<br><br>Above, we have leaned into creating a hero page as something personal to share, like a social media profile. That is still a great way to use a hero page, but that is just the beginning.<br><br>If you run a business, you can use a hero page to share links and posts with current and potential customers. For freelancers, it is a great way to create a portfolio you can share.<br><br>Holding an event and wanting to share details and updates leading up to it? Then create a hero page.<br><br>Following that, you can use the hero page to share the wrap up- the stories, the photos and anything else you can think of.<br><br>For the personal trainers and/or nutritionists out there. Imagine creating a resource that links to all the amazing recipes you have found out there or workout programs or studies that will help your clients.<br><br>In a simple, shareable link, you can give them access to all the information you have been able to compile. This goes for anybody who works with people.<br><br>Perhaps you want to use it as a personal database. For those with hobbies, it is ideal for sharing links to different sites and information that will help your community thrive.<br><br>It is a way to create a way to collate information for a family member who may not be as tech-savvy. You can give them a one-stop place to access everything you want to send them.<br><br>What's the best part? Your unique Hero page has a "Share link" button on it and a "QR Code" button, which will let you share your hero links with anyone, at any time, in any place.<br><br>When you create a list of links on one page, that page will also have a "QR Code" button. Sharing is caring, and we care.</p><span id="the-magic-of-a-hero-page"></span><br><br><br><h2 class="sc-fmrZth bbgwqn">4. The Magic of a Hero Page</h2><br><p class="sc-iqGgem hvrSHD">Have you ever created a blog or website, only to forget to renew the domain and suddenly it is inactive, lost to the internet for a fee?<br><br>Perhaps you are still lamenting the loss of your Myspace page or Angel Fire website. If those references have gone over your head, that is okay.<br><br>The main point to take away is that hosting space on the internet can cost money. That is the beauty of a hero page. It is absolutely free.<br><br>Whether you use it as a portfolio, an archive, or to share links between family and friends- you do not have to pay to host the content. Not only that, but you also choose what is on your page.<br><br>It can be as broad or niche as you want it to be. It is for sharing, so whatever you want can have space on your hero page.<br><br>Another plus is that you can request features for your page. Want to share something that you need help finding an option for? Then you can message the creators of Hero. The aim is to make this a place for you.</p><span id="why-you-need-a-hero-page"></span><br><br><br><h2 class="sc-fmrZth bbgwqn">5. Why You Need a Hero Page</h2><br><p class="sc-iqGgem hvrSHD">All these ideas of what you can do with a hero page may be moving away from the question of what a hero page is, which you may not have even had until you stumbled upon this blog.<br><br>The main thing to take away is that a hero page is a place for you. It is a gateway to creating a place to share what you want and with whom you want. The only limit is your imagination.<br><br>You can share what you find on the internet, in one link. You are not limited to one page, or a set number of links.<br><br>It's unlimited, just like your imagination!<br><br>What are you waiting for? <a href="/create-account" class="sc-dvwKko kvIomC">Sign up for free</a>, and start sharing links to your heart's content!</p><div height="50" class="sc-hKMtZM gcUkXq"></div><div class="sc-gJwTLC elYxIv row"><div class="col-xl-6 col-md-6 col-12" style="padding: 10px;"><h3 class="sc-fxvKuh dmBEt">Learn More</h3><button class="sc-bTMaZy dCSebc">Explore</button><button class="sc-bTMaZy dCSebc">Features</button><button class="sc-bTMaZy dCSebc">Download on iOS &amp; Android</button><h3 class="sc-fxvKuh dmBEt">Share Links with Hero</h3><p class="sc-dkSuNL hSYOOf">Hero lets you create Spaces, which are <br>collections of lists, to share with anyone in the world! <br><br>Create your Hero Profile (for free) and <br> start creating &amp; sharing links today!</p></div><div class="col-xl-6 col-md-6 col-12" style="padding: 10px;"><h3 class="sc-fxvKuh dmBEt">Link in Bio for Social Media</h3><button class="sc-bTMaZy dCSebc">Link in Bio for TikTok</button><button class="sc-bTMaZy dCSebc">Link in Bio for Instagram</button><button class="sc-bTMaZy dCSebc">Link in Bio for Twitter</button><h3 class="sc-fxvKuh dmBEt">Why Hero?</h3><p class="sc-dkSuNL hSYOOf">Hero is the only free link sharing platform<br> that allows multiple public Spaces! <br> <br>You can link your socials, add unlimited Spaces &amp;<br> unlimited Links to your Hero Profile.</p><div height="20" class="sc-hKMtZM iQiTYl"></div></div></div></div></div></div><div height="50" class="sc-hKMtZM gcUkXq"></div><div class="container"><div class="sc-eCYdqJ iJfXKh"><div class="row" style="width: 100%;"><div class="col-xl-12 col-md-12 col-12" style="padding: 10px; text-align: start;"><div class="sc-gsnTZi hSJpZc"><div wrap="1" class="sc-gsnTZi cjBus"><span class="sc-jSMfEi hmxtwj">Our Socials</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/heropage_" class="sc-gKXOVf daFjVS">Instagram</a><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/heropage_" class="sc-gKXOVf daFjVS">Twitter</a><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/hero-page" class="sc-gKXOVf daFjVS">LinkedIn</a><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/hero-share-discover-lists" class="sc-gKXOVf daFjVS">Product Hunt</a></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-12 col-md-12 col-12" style="padding: 10px; text-align: start;"><div class="sc-gsnTZi hSJpZc"><div wrap="1" class="sc-gsnTZi cjBus"><span class="sc-jSMfEi hmxtwj">Help</span><a href="/podcasts" class="sc-gKXOVf daFjVS">For Podcast Hosts</a><a href="mailto:hello@hero.page" class="sc-gKXOVf daFjVS">Report a Bug or Profile</a><a href="mailto:hello@hero.page" class="sc-gKXOVf daFjVS">Contact Us</a><a href="/explore" class="sc-gKXOVf daFjVS">Explore</a></div></div></div><div class="col-xl-12 col-md-12 col-12" style="padding: 10px; text-align: start;"><div class="sc-gsnTZi hSJpZc"><div wrap="1" class="sc-gsnTZi cjBus"><span class="sc-jSMfEi hmxtwj">Resources</span><a href="/blog" style="text-decoration: none; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><span class="sc-iBkjds eekNVI">Blog</span></a><a href="/help/introduction-to-hero" style="text-decoration: none; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><span class="sc-iBkjds eekNVI">List Maker Docs</span></a><a href="/privacy-policy" style="text-decoration: none; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><span class="sc-iBkjds eekNVI">Privacy Policy</span></a><a href="/terms-and-conditions" style="text-decoration: none; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><span class="sc-iBkjds eekNVI">Terms &amp; Conditions</span></a></div></div></div></div><div class="sc-gsnTZi dpVpgP"><span class="sc-iBkjds eekNVI" style="text-decoration: none; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;">v5.0.0</span></div></div></div><div height="30" class="sc-hKMtZM glCpoA"></div></div><div class="Toastify"></div></div></div></body></html>
