So when he sees Sougo Kijima, a Bestia who lets his instincts run him wild, there's something that makes the doctor snarl. Sougo Kijima is one of the directors of the hospital where Dr. Miyaji works.

<hr><b>Blur:</b><div>In the third district of a certain town, there are only male cats. Rikuo, a smaller cat, has been the alpha leader of the turf for a long time. Even though most of the cats have left the third district as they got older, Rikuo's been a very reliable leader who's protected the area from invading cats. Toraji, a cat that Rikuo found abandoned as a kitten, has challenged Rikuo for the alpha leader's position. Will Toraji, who just turned into an adult, be able to get Rikuo on his knees...? Another story included is about Kuro, who has a serious problem as a male cat, and Ao, a house cat who knows nothing about his own physical needs and issues.</div><hr><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="/lostteen/boys-love-comics/i/a-perfect-day-for-cb9Kar5xYeFSJ5iznq04" style="font-size: 14px; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(232, 47, 100); font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer;">CLICK HERE</a></div></span></span></div></div><div class="sc-dkzDqf jSSkau"><div height="10" class="sc-hKMtZM foaLnS"></div><div class="sc-gsnTZi hzDQTo" style="padding: 5px 16px; filter: blur(0px);"><div class="sc-gsnTZi gursw"><a class="sc-DdwlG hCPdfI" href="/lostteen"><div class="sc-gsnTZi gursw"><div class="MuiAvatar-root MuiAvatar-circular css-132pgjw"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/focushero-1650416072840.appspot.com/o/profile_pictures%2FijpPm2BGQhf7R0V3hn38HmCywb63?alt=media&amp;token=da730f3d-8c99-4575-80bb-01d8740deebb" class="MuiAvatar-img css-1hy9t21" loading="lazy"></div><div width="5" class="sc-gsnTZi jYLFkN"></div>Added by @lostteen<div width="5" class="sc-gsnTZi jYLFkN"></div><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-1yls13q" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-testid="OpenInNewRoundedIcon"><path d="M18 19H6c-.55 0-1-.45-1-1V6c0-.55.45-1 1-1h5c.55 0 1-.45 1-1s-.45-1-1-1H5c-1.11 0-2 .9-2 2v14c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h14c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2v-6c0-.55-.45-1-1-1s-1 .45-1 1v5c0 .55-.45 1-1 1zM14 4c0 .55.45 1 1 1h2.59l-9.13 9.13c-.39.39-.39 1.02 0 1.41.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L19 6.41V9c0 .55.45 1 1 1s1-.45 1-1V4c0-.55-.45-1-1-1h-5c-.55 0-1 .45-1 1z"></path></svg></div></a></div><div class="sc-gsnTZi gursw"><a data-tip="Open item in new page or share it!" aria-label="Open item in new page or share it!" data-place="left" data-effect="solid" data-for="save_item" class="sc-hKdnnL gTdmWc" href="/lostteen/animal-characteristics/i/a-perfect-day-for-Q1P281Ifgb1liPEBB7fI" currentitem="false"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-vubbuv" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-testid="OpenInFullIcon" style="font-size: 16px;"><path d="M21 11V3h-8l3.29 3.29-10 10L3 13v8h8l-3.29-3.29 10-10z"></path></svg></a><button data-tip="Add item to one of your Spaces" aria-label="Add item to one of your Spaces" data-place="left" data-effect="solid" data-for="save_item" class="sc-gVAlfg gIrlLw" currentitem="false"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-vubbuv" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-testid="BookmarkAddRoundedIcon" style="font-size: 16px;"><path d="M21 6c0 .55-.45 1-1 1h-1v1c0 .55-.45 1-1 1s-1-.45-1-1V7h-1c-.55 0-1-.45-1-1s.45-1 1-1h1V4c0-.55.45-1 1-1s1 .45 1 1v1h1c.55 0 1 .45 1 1zm-2 13.48c0 .72-.73 1.2-1.39.92L12 18l-5.61 2.4c-.66.29-1.39-.2-1.39-.92V5c0-1.1.9-2 2-2h7c-.63.84-1 1.87-1 3 0 2.76 2.24 5 5 5 .34 0 .68-.03 1-.1v8.58z"></path></svg><div width="10" class="sc-bczRLJ cLiLil"></div><small>Save</small></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="__react_component_tooltip t41fe11e9-126a-433d-b068-c28905c06470 place-top type-dark" id="save_item" data-id="tooltip"><style aria-hidden="true">

It's about a male calico cat that kept appearing when he was feeding the cats near the school as part of his daily routine. And… there's also the fact that he finds Sasaki, a student from the same seminar, to be cute. One day, he found out that Sasaki is a werecat as well as that calico cat. And from then on, he can cuddle and pet Sasaki’s cat form all he wants! But the more time they spend together, the more Matsumoto’s feelings for Sasaki go in a direction other than friendship… This is a fluffy sweet werebeast love story between a quiet Kishu weredog who likes to take care of others and an honestly sweet werecat who start out as friends.</div><hr><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="/lostteen/boys-love-comics/i/play-biting-you-1PNcbs3qoXMGHPtfvPAg" style="font-size: 14px; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(232, 47, 100); font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer;">CLICK HERE</a></div></span></span></div></div><div class="sc-dkzDqf jSSkau"><div height="10" class="sc-hKMtZM foaLnS"></div><div class="sc-gsnTZi hzDQTo" style="padding: 5px 16px; filter: blur(0px);"><div class="sc-gsnTZi gursw"><a class="sc-DdwlG hCPdfI" href="/lostteen"><div class="sc-gsnTZi gursw"><div class="MuiAvatar-root MuiAvatar-circular css-132pgjw"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/focushero-1650416072840.appspot.com/o/profile_pictures%2FijpPm2BGQhf7R0V3hn38HmCywb63?alt=media&amp;token=da730f3d-8c99-4575-80bb-01d8740deebb" class="MuiAvatar-img css-1hy9t21" loading="lazy"></div><div width="5" class="sc-gsnTZi jYLFkN"></div>Added by @lostteen<div width="5" class="sc-gsnTZi jYLFkN"></div><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-1yls13q" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-testid="OpenInNewRoundedIcon"><path d="M18 19H6c-.55 0-1-.45-1-1V6c0-.55.45-1 1-1h5c.55 0 1-.45 1-1s-.45-1-1-1H5c-1.11 0-2 .9-2 2v14c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h14c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2v-6c0-.55-.45-1-1-1s-1 .45-1 1v5c0 .55-.45 1-1 1zM14 4c0 .55.45 1 1 1h2.59l-9.13 9.13c-.39.39-.39 1.02 0 1.41.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L19 6.41V9c0 .55.45 1 1 1s1-.45 1-1V4c0-.55-.45-1-1-1h-5c-.55 0-1 .45-1 1z"></path></svg></div></a></div><div class="sc-gsnTZi gursw"><a data-tip="Open item in new page or share it!" aria-label="Open item in new page or share it!" data-place="left" data-effect="solid" data-for="save_item" class="sc-hKdnnL gTdmWc" href="/lostteen/animal-characteristics/i/play-biting-you-ySBhIbOjPODG1LFljpvf" currentitem="false"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-vubbuv" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-testid="OpenInFullIcon" style="font-size: 16px;"><path d="M21 11V3h-8l3.29 3.29-10 10L3 13v8h8l-3.29-3.29 10-10z"></path></svg></a><button data-tip="Add item to one of your Spaces" aria-label="Add item to one of your Spaces" data-place="left" data-effect="solid" data-for="save_item" class="sc-gVAlfg gIrlLw" currentitem="false"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-vubbuv" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-testid="BookmarkAddRoundedIcon" style="font-size: 16px;"><path d="M21 6c0 .55-.45 1-1 1h-1v1c0 .55-.45 1-1 1s-1-.45-1-1V7h-1c-.55 0-1-.45-1-1s.45-1 1-1h1V4c0-.55.45-1 1-1s1 .45 1 1v1h1c.55 0 1 .45 1 1zm-2 13.48c0 .72-.73 1.2-1.39.92L12 18l-5.61 2.4c-.66.29-1.39-.2-1.39-.92V5c0-1.1.9-2 2-2h7c-.63.84-1 1.87-1 3 0 2.76 2.24 5 5 5 .34 0 .68-.03 1-.1v8.58z"></path></svg><div width="10" class="sc-bczRLJ cLiLil"></div><small>Save</small></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="__react_component_tooltip t61f9e972-d1ec-4ffd-a201-54a3d2acd6a5 place-top type-dark" id="save_item" data-id="tooltip"><style aria-hidden="true">

When Bella suddenly goes into heat, things come to a head, and only the mysterious alpha beast-man Juda tries to help.</div><hr><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="/lostteen/boys-love-comics/i/remnant-jujin-omegaverse-L3RJKP9aYbSReXQUgfiR" style="font-size: 14px; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(232, 47, 100); font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer;">CLICK HERE</a></div></span></span></div></div><div class="sc-dkzDqf jSSkau"><div height="10" class="sc-hKMtZM foaLnS"></div><div class="sc-gsnTZi hzDQTo" style="padding: 5px 16px; filter: blur(0px);"><div class="sc-gsnTZi gursw"><a class="sc-DdwlG hCPdfI" href="/lostteen"><div class="sc-gsnTZi gursw"><div class="MuiAvatar-root MuiAvatar-circular css-132pgjw"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/focushero-1650416072840.appspot.com/o/profile_pictures%2FijpPm2BGQhf7R0V3hn38HmCywb63?alt=media&amp;token=da730f3d-8c99-4575-80bb-01d8740deebb" class="MuiAvatar-img css-1hy9t21" loading="lazy"></div><div width="5" class="sc-gsnTZi jYLFkN"></div>Added by @lostteen<div width="5" class="sc-gsnTZi jYLFkN"></div><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-1yls13q" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-testid="OpenInNewRoundedIcon"><path d="M18 19H6c-.55 0-1-.45-1-1V6c0-.55.45-1 1-1h5c.55 0 1-.45 1-1s-.45-1-1-1H5c-1.11 0-2 .9-2 2v14c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h14c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2v-6c0-.55-.45-1-1-1s-1 .45-1 1v5c0 .55-.45 1-1 1zM14 4c0 .55.45 1 1 1h2.59l-9.13 9.13c-.39.39-.39 1.02 0 1.41.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L19 6.41V9c0 .55.45 1 1 1s1-.45 1-1V4c0-.55-.45-1-1-1h-5c-.55 0-1 .45-1 1z"></path></svg></div></a></div><div class="sc-gsnTZi gursw"><a data-tip="Open item in new page or share it!" aria-label="Open item in new page or share it!" data-place="left" data-effect="solid" data-for="save_item" class="sc-hKdnnL gTdmWc" href="/lostteen/animal-characteristics/i/remnant-jujin-omegaverse-27qp3noqvr2UJcnZm1ui" currentitem="false"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-vubbuv" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-testid="OpenInFullIcon" style="font-size: 16px;"><path d="M21 11V3h-8l3.29 3.29-10 10L3 13v8h8l-3.29-3.29 10-10z"></path></svg></a><button data-tip="Add item to one of your Spaces" aria-label="Add item to one of your Spaces" data-place="left" data-effect="solid" data-for="save_item" class="sc-gVAlfg gIrlLw" currentitem="false"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-vubbuv" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-testid="BookmarkAddRoundedIcon" style="font-size: 16px;"><path d="M21 6c0 .55-.45 1-1 1h-1v1c0 .55-.45 1-1 1s-1-.45-1-1V7h-1c-.55 0-1-.45-1-1s.45-1 1-1h1V4c0-.55.45-1 1-1s1 .45 1 1v1h1c.55 0 1 .45 1 1zm-2 13.48c0 .72-.73 1.2-1.39.92L12 18l-5.61 2.4c-.66.29-1.39-.2-1.39-.92V5c0-1.1.9-2 2-2h7c-.63.84-1 1.87-1 3 0 2.76 2.24 5 5 5 .34 0 .68-.03 1-.1v8.58z"></path></svg><div width="10" class="sc-bczRLJ cLiLil"></div><small>Save</small></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="__react_component_tooltip t4b438067-f69f-4740-97c9-7125617168f9 place-top type-dark" id="save_item" data-id="tooltip"><style aria-hidden="true">

Hinata's disguised as a female at the wedding and has ulterior motives for his soon-to-be husband: he plans to kill Kyouya, who's the son of the wolf pack's leader...
The night of their wedding, he tries to carry out the assassination, but Kyouya catches on and he fails.
Because he has nine tails, Hinata's even an outcast in his own pack and he decides to wants to die. But, instead of killing him, Kyouya says, "It's time for our honeymoon" and takes him prisoner...
