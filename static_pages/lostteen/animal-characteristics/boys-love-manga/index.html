Dr. Akira Miyaji specializes in treating Bestian patients and is a Bestia himself. Born to non-eared parents, he has been raised thinking he must suppress his instincts. So when he sees Sougo Kijima, a Bestia who lets his instincts run him wild, there's something that makes the doctor snarl. Sougo Kijima is one of the directors of the hospital where Dr. Miyaji works. And to make matters worse, Kijima has designated Dr. Miyaji specifically to be his practitioner!

Even though most of the cats have left the third district as they got older, Rikuo's been a very reliable leader who's protected the area from invading cats. Toraji, a cat that Rikuo found abandoned as a kitten, has challenged Rikuo for the alpha leader's position. Will Toraji, who just turned into an adult, be able to get Rikuo on his knees...?

<b>Uke/Bottom</b><div>Is a cat</div><hr><b>Blur:</b><div>“I… want to be friends with you, Matsumoto!” In the present day where humans and werebeast are living in harmony, there is something that has been bothering Matsumoto, a Kishu weredog, who actually likes cats. It's about a male calico cat that kept appearing when he was feeding the cats near the school as part of his daily routine. And… there's also the fact that he finds Sasaki, a student from the same seminar, to be cute. One day, he found out that Sasaki is a werecat as well as that calico cat. And from then on, he can cuddle and pet Sasaki’s cat form all he wants! But the more time they spend together, the more Matsumoto’s feelings for Sasaki go in a direction other than friendship… This is a fluffy sweet werebeast love story between a quiet Kishu weredog who likes to take care of others and an honestly sweet werecat who start out as friends.</div><hr><a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="/lostteen/boys-love-comics/i/play-biting-you-1PNcbs3qoXMGHPtfvPAg" style="font-size: 14px; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(232, 47, 100); font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer;">CLICK HERE</a></div></span></span></div></div><div class="sc-dkzDqf jSSkau"><div height="10" class="sc-hKMtZM foaLnS"></div><div class="sc-gsnTZi hzDQTo" style="padding: 5px 16px; filter: blur(0px);"><div class="sc-gsnTZi gursw"><a class="sc-DdwlG hCPdfI" href="/lostteen"><div class="sc-gsnTZi gursw"><div class="MuiAvatar-root MuiAvatar-circular css-132pgjw"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/focushero-1650416072840.appspot.com/o/profile_pictures%2FijpPm2BGQhf7R0V3hn38HmCywb63?alt=media&amp;token=da730f3d-8c99-4575-80bb-01d8740deebb" class="MuiAvatar-img css-1hy9t21" loading="lazy"></div><div width="5" class="sc-gsnTZi jYLFkN"></div>Added by @lostteen<div width="5" class="sc-gsnTZi jYLFkN"></div><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-1yls13q" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-testid="OpenInNewRoundedIcon"><path d="M18 19H6c-.55 0-1-.45-1-1V6c0-.55.45-1 1-1h5c.55 0 1-.45 1-1s-.45-1-1-1H5c-1.11 0-2 .9-2 2v14c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h14c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2v-6c0-.55-.45-1-1-1s-1 .45-1 1v5c0 .55-.45 1-1 1zM14 4c0 .55.45 1 1 1h2.59l-9.13 9.13c-.39.39-.39 1.02 0 1.41.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L19 6.41V9c0 .55.45 1 1 1s1-.45 1-1V4c0-.55-.45-1-1-1h-5c-.55 0-1 .45-1 1z"></path></svg></div></a></div><div class="sc-gsnTZi gursw"><a data-tip="Open item in new page or share it!" aria-label="Open item in new page or share it!" data-place="left" data-effect="solid" data-for="save_item" class="sc-hKdnnL gTdmWc" href="/lostteen/animal-characteristics/i/play-biting-you-ySBhIbOjPODG1LFljpvf" currentitem="false"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-vubbuv" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-testid="OpenInFullIcon" style="font-size: 16px;"><path d="M21 11V3h-8l3.29 3.29-10 10L3 13v8h8l-3.29-3.29 10-10z"></path></svg></a><button data-tip="Add item to one of your Spaces" aria-label="Add item to one of your Spaces" data-place="left" data-effect="solid" data-for="save_item" class="sc-gVAlfg gIrlLw" currentitem="false"><svg class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-vubbuv" focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" data-testid="BookmarkAddRoundedIcon" style="font-size: 16px;"><path d="M21 6c0 .55-.45 1-1 1h-1v1c0 .55-.45 1-1 1s-1-.45-1-1V7h-1c-.55 0-1-.45-1-1s.45-1 1-1h1V4c0-.55.45-1 1-1s1 .45 1 1v1h1c.55 0 1 .45 1 1zm-2 13.48c0 .72-.73 1.2-1.39.92L12 18l-5.61 2.4c-.66.29-1.39-.2-1.39-.92V5c0-1.1.9-2 2-2h7c-.63.84-1 1.87-1 3 0 2.76 2.24 5 5 5 .34 0 .68-.03 1-.1v8.58z"></path></svg><div width="10" class="sc-bczRLJ cLiLil"></div><small>Save</small></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="__react_component_tooltip t7e8d774a-a586-4c65-bfbf-49661538b1b0 place-top type-dark" id="save_item" data-id="tooltip"><style aria-hidden="true">
